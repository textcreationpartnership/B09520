            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

I readily grant, That the Custome of <hi>Praising the Dead,</hi> ha's been Scandalously Abused; but I cannot grant, That the Abuse is best Corrected, by taking away all <hi>Publick Meditations,</hi> on the <hi>Funerals</hi> of Those, in whose <hi>Deaths</hi> God from Heaven speaks Great Things unto the <hi>Living.</hi> We do but wisely Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil our Ministry, by <hi>Watching,</hi> to suit the <hi>Words</hi> of

The best sort of <hi>Reliques,</hi> are those which we have here preserved, &amp; proposed; &amp; it will be no <hi>Superstition,</hi> to hope, that a cure of Spiritual Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies too generally prevailing, may be promoted, by Repairing unto them. And, I do not more question the Opinion of a very Learned man, concerning the <hi>Angels,</hi> whom we find mention'd in the Scriptures as doing very <hi>Humane</hi> Actions, <hi>Veros Homines fuisse, qui a Spiritu Messiae, et a Spiriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Angelicis agebantur; et movebantur ad ea Agenda, quae ipsi non intelligebant, phantasia Eorum obsessa, et a Cogitationibus consuetis abducta: Qui Homines, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotio peractoâ–ª ad quod fuerant a Deo adhibiti, discusso veterno, et cessante Ecstasi, ad Consueta munera reversi sunt, immemores eorum, quae Impulsore Spiritu Divino, aut Angelico, egerant:</hi> Than I do believe, That in our <hi>Actions,</hi> there is an Imitation of the Holy <hi>Angels</hi> to be endeavoured, by which a man, may become another <hi>Stephen.</hi>

            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:185005:5"/>
            <p>'Tis well known, That among the chief Works of the Most High, Created by the Son of God, at the First Beginning of Time, there were His <hi>Good</hi> ANGELS: <hi>Angels,</hi> which are Spiritual and Rational Substances, Created by the Lord, for His own Immediate Service and Honour. None Deny, None Dispute, the Existence of those <hi>Good Angels,</hi> but men that are under a more than ordinary Possession of <hi>Evil</hi> Ones.</p>
            <p>Our Lord Jesus Christ, has given it, as a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of that <hi>Future State,</hi> wherein He will make us Happy for ever, Math. 22. 30. <hi>They are as the Angels of God in Heaven.</hi> And if we Hope, to be <hi>Happy</hi> in that <hi>Future State,</hi> we must endeavour to Anticipate it, by being very <hi>Holy</hi> in our <hi>Present State.</hi> But the way for us, to be very <hi>Holy,</hi> is to Resemble, and Imitate, the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God in Heaven,</hi> while we are on Earth, as far as we are able. Every <hi>Holy man</hi> does a <hi>Little</hi> of This; and <hi>how much</hi> of it, was done by that <hi>Holy man,</hi> who is now gone to Live, and Praise, and see CHRIST, among the <hi>Angels</hi> for ever, may be proposed with some Advantage unto the <hi>Exhortation,</hi> wherein I have a <hi>few Things to Preach unto the People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But my <hi>Exhortation</hi> must be introduced, with a Report of that <hi>Glory,</hi> which the Martyr <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,</hi> while he was yet on Earth, attain'd unto.</p>
            <p>There being occasion to choose <hi>Deacons</hi> in the Primitive Church, that so they who were to give themselves continually unto the <hi>Ministry of</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:185005:5"/>
               <hi>the Word,</hi> might be Released, by the faithful Cares of those <hi>Deacons,</hi> from Secular Encumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; <hi>One</hi> of them was the Blessed <hi>Stephen;</hi> who being the First that arriv'd unto the <hi>Crown of Martyrdome</hi> for our Lord Jesus Christ, in the New-Testament, had in the Name of <hi>Stephen,</hi> which signifies, <hi>A Crown,</hi> a notable Specification, of the <hi>Event</hi> and <hi>Reward,</hi> which will attend all our <hi>Sufferings</hi> for the Lord.</p>
            <p>It was then an Age of many <hi>Miracles</hi> wrought by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ; and such a <hi>measure</hi> of that <hi>Spirit,</hi> possessed this Excellent man, that by the <hi>Impulse</hi> of that <hi>Spirit,</hi> He could, with all Assurance, perceive when the <hi>Spirit</hi> was going to work <hi>Miracles,</hi> and apply himself to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the <hi>Miracles</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> by some wonderful <hi>Actions</hi> of his own. This Illustrious Worker of <hi>Miracles,</hi> was Accused before the <hi>Council</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> for saying, That it was the Design of <hi>Jesus,</hi> to destroy the <hi>Temple,</hi> and the <hi>City,</hi> and alter the <hi>Rites,</hi> which <hi>Moses</hi> had, from God, commanded unto <hi>Israel.</hi> When he appear'd before the <hi>Council</hi> to answer this Accusation, 'tis here said, <hi>They saw his Face, as it had been the Face of an Angel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>Face of an Angel,</hi> we have a Remarkable Account, in what we read about one of the <hi>Angels,</hi> in Mat. 28. 3. His <hi>Countenance was like Lightning.</hi> And we read concerning a Great man, who had got the <hi>Face of an Angel,</hi> by being much with the <hi>Angels,</hi> in Exod 34. 10. <hi>Behold,</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:185005:6"/>
               <hi>the skin of his Face shone.</hi> If we carry the passage now before us, unto the Highest sense, which it would lay claim unto, we are to suppose, That such a <hi>Splendor</hi> was discernible upon the <hi>Face</hi> of <hi>Stephen:</hi> And surely, if they who discerned it, had not had the <hi>Heart of a Devil</hi> in them, they durst not have gone on, to Abuse a <hi>man,</hi> that Appeared before them, with the <hi>Face of an Angel.</hi> Alas, the more of an <hi>Angel</hi> there is in any <hi>man,</hi> the more <hi>Stones</hi> will the <hi>Devil</hi> procure to be thrown at such a <hi>Man!</hi> But, behold, the <hi>Agreeableness</hi> of the matter; <hi>Stephen</hi> was persecuted for vilifying of <hi>Moses;</hi> and, behold, at this very Time, he is vindicated with a <hi>Shine</hi> upon his <hi>Face,</hi> like that once upon the <hi>Face</hi> of <hi>Moses.</hi> The Things here spoken by <hi>Stephen,</hi> were those very Things, which the <hi>Angel Gabriel,</hi> had formerly spoken unto the <hi>Prophet Daniel;</hi> and behold, the Aspect of an <hi>Angel</hi> adorns him, in his Discourse.</p>
            <p>We may from hence, take Leave to Observe, <hi>That a</hi> Saint on Earth, <hi>may arrive to those Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that shall make him Look like an</hi> Angel of Heaven.</p>
            <p>There are <hi>Angelical Excellencies,</hi> a Degree whereof, poor <hi>man,</hi> sorry <hi>man,</hi> sinful <hi>man,</hi> even while such, may very much attain unto.</p>
            <p>But now, this CASE calls for our Attention; <hi>What are those Excellencies, that would make a Saint, Look like an</hi> ANGEL?</p>
            <p>And the General Answer hereunto is, The <hi>Excellencies of Holiness,</hi> For,</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:185005:6"/>
            <p> First, The <hi>Angels</hi> of God, have many <hi>Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies,</hi> the Imitation whereof cannot by men in this Life, be Reasonably proposed. The <hi>Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Majesty,</hi> as a <hi>Mortal Eye</hi> would not be able steadily to <hi>Behold</hi> it, much less, in this <hi>Mortal State,</hi> may we <hi>Affect</hi> it. A man may not wish to <hi>Shine</hi> like <hi>Stephen,</hi> in this World, and have a <hi>Face,</hi> that may dazzle the Spectators. Or, what would it avail, if a man could make a Glare on his <hi>Face,</hi> by smearing it with some of the <hi>Noctilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca's</hi> invented by the <hi>Modern Chymistry?</hi> A <hi>Devil</hi> has before now, pretended unto such a <hi>Face.</hi> 'Tis not the <hi>Face,</hi> but the <hi>Grace,</hi> of an <hi>Angel,</hi> which is here to be Aspired after. It were a Foolish, and a Faulty Thing, for any man, to be ambitious, of wearing in this World, such a Figure, as that in Dan. 10. 6. <hi>His Body like the Beryl, and his Face as the Appearance of Lightning, and his Eyes as Lamps of Fire. Immortality</hi> it self, is one of the <hi>Angelical Excellencies.</hi> But, while we are among <hi>Mortals</hi> here, we must submit unto the Laws of <hi>Mortality,</hi> and be willing to <hi>Dy,</hi> When, and How, the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign God shall order it. There are also, those Flights of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and those Heights of <hi>Power</hi> among the <hi>Angelical Excellencies;</hi> wherein, 'tis not for us, to Dream of being <hi>Like</hi> them, until we are become, <hi>The Children of the Resurrectionâ–ª</hi> It was the Ruine of our <hi>First Parents,</hi> to imagine, in Gen. 3. 5. They <hi>might be as Elohim!</hi> No, this cannot be, until our Lord Jesus Christ, has by a <hi>New Birth</hi> brought us into that <hi>World to come,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:185005:7"/> where, the <hi>Wise Converters of many to Righteousness,</hi> will be those, who shall <hi>Shine as the Brightness of the Firmament, and as the Stars for ever and ever!</hi> Our Lord Jesus Christ, will make <hi>us</hi> the <hi>Angels</hi> of the <hi>New World.</hi> Indeed the <hi>Angels</hi> now turn and move all the <hi>Wheels</hi> of the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of <hi>this World,</hi> but <hi>we</hi> are they that shall <hi>Receive the Kingdom that cannot be moved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, Secondly, The <hi>Excellencies of Holiness,</hi> [For, the <hi>Saints,</hi> are the <hi>Excellent!]</hi> These are They, wherein the Imitation of the <hi>Angels</hi> by <hi>men,</hi> may be very far proceeded in. The <hi>Angels</hi> of God, are styled, in Mat. 25. 31. <hi>The Holy Angels;</hi> and in Dan. 4. 17. <hi>The Holy Ones.</hi> 'Tis not as they are <hi>Mighty Angels,</hi> but as they are <hi>Holy Angels,</hi> that we must propound our coming to Look like unto them. These <hi>Holy Angels,</hi> never did, and never will Sin against their God; but are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually Serving of Him; <hi>They Serve Him Day and Night in His Temple!</hi> And it may be, the <hi>Bright Garments,</hi> wherein these <hi>Angels of Light,</hi> have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, may be an Emblem of their <hi>Holiness</hi> and their <hi>Purity.</hi> Now it hath been the <hi>Will of God in our Lord Jesus Christ concerning us,</hi> that there should be set before us, the Greatest Exemples of <hi>Holiness</hi> for our Imitation. And hence, as we have the Greater <hi>Exemple</hi> of our Lord JESUS CHRIST Himself given unto us, to Direct and Excite and Promote our <hi>Holiness,</hi> with a Charge, <hi>To be Holy, as He that hath called us is Holy;</hi> So, we have also the <hi>Exemple</hi> of the <hi>Holy Angels</hi> given unto us, That
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:185005:7"/> we may strive as far as may be, to be Like unto them in their <hi>Holiness.</hi> Hence when the Psamist of old saw the <hi>Angels</hi> praising of God, he cryed out, <hi>O my Soul, do Thou so too!</hi> Yea, some Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters Judge, That when the <hi>Face</hi> of <hi>Stephen</hi> Look'd like an <hi>Angel,</hi> it was no more than what you and I may <hi>thro' Christ who strengthens us,</hi> reach unto. <hi>q d.</hi> The <hi>Consolations</hi> of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> of God, so filled him, that he discovered not the least <hi>Consternations</hi> in his <hi>Face:</hi> His <hi>Face</hi> was as Joyful, and Serene, as if he had stood free from all the <hi>Sorrows</hi> of this World, among the <hi>Angels</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>I remember the Apostle Enjoins the <hi>Woman</hi> in the Church to have a covering on her Head, in Token of Subjection to her <hi>Husband; Because of the Angels.</hi> [2 Cor. 11. 10.] Why, if you turn to the Beginning of the sixth Chapter of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> you'l find the <hi>Angels</hi> before their Superiour, the Lord Jesus Christ, in the <hi>Temple</hi> assuming a <hi>Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> out of the Reverence which they pay unto Him. Hence then, says the Apostle, it becomes <hi>Women</hi> to take <hi>Example</hi> by the <hi>Angels;</hi> let them consider, how the <hi>Angels</hi> behave themselves in the Presence of the <hi>Son</hi> of God, who is the Grand Representative of the <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of God; and let them in their <hi>Habit</hi> show some Analogy to the <hi>Habit</hi> of the <hi>Angels:</hi> betokening their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the <hi>man,</hi> who is under the Lord Jesus Christ, the <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of God, while <hi>They</hi> the <hi>Women,</hi> are so of the <hi>man.</hi> But I only touch
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:185005:8"/> on this gloss, by the by. What I insist on, is, That the <hi>Angelical Example</hi> is to be imitated.</p>
            <p>Indeed, we shall, as long as we Live in this World, come far short of the <hi>Original,</hi> when we go to Write after the <hi>Angelical Example.</hi> In this <hi>Present Evil World,</hi> we cannot approach near to the <hi>Holiness</hi> of the <hi>Good Angels:</hi> Much of Sin, and Fault, &amp; Folly, will unavoidably cleave unto us: That <hi>Leprosy</hi> will never wholly out of the <hi>Walls,</hi> until the <hi>Clay-house</hi> be utterly demolished: There will be as much Distance between the <hi>Blessed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> and <hi>Us,</hi> as between <hi>Giants</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Stars</hi> and <hi>Gloworms,</hi> as between the <hi>Cedars</hi> of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> and the <hi>Hysop</hi> that <hi>Grows out of the Wall;</hi> Thus it will be, until we come at length to dwell [And, <hi>Oh! Why do we no more Long for it!]</hi> with the <hi>Innumerable Company of Angels,</hi> in another World.</p>
            <p>However, to Attempt the Imitation, is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy way to be <hi>Excellent.</hi> Particularly in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing Instances.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> If a man could have his <hi>Eye</hi> upon the <hi>Face of God</hi> continually, would not that procure the <hi>Face of an Angel</hi> for him? It would make a man Look like an <hi>Angel,</hi> if he were Looking unto God, in the Lord Jesus Christ continually. Of the <hi>Angels</hi> there is that Account given, in Mat. 18. 10. <hi>In the Heavens, they do always behold the Face of my Father which is in the Heavens.</hi> The <hi>Angels</hi> do converse with GOD continually. And, why may not we press after a converse with GOD, a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:185005:8"/> little Emulating the <hi>Angelical?</hi> To be <hi>Heavenly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded,</hi> by having the <hi>God of Heaven</hi> almost al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in our minds, and by being <hi>in the Fear of God all the Day Long; This</hi> were to be as the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> are! Oh! That we were thus, <hi>Filled with all the Fulness of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, We may have a continual <hi>Apprehension</hi> of GOD in our minds. In every <hi>Place,</hi> we may Apprehend GOD Wherever we are, we may Subscribe to that Article of the Ancient Faith, in Psal. 139. 7. Lord, <hi>Whither shall I flee from thy Presence?</hi> What if we should never be from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Awe of such a Thought as that, <hi>The Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipresent God observes all my wayes!</hi> And we may Apprehend GOD, in every <hi>Thing.</hi> We need not stay at any <hi>Second Causes;</hi> but we may with a <hi>Spiritualized Soul,</hi> Soar up to some Notice of <hi>God</hi> in all. Upon all the Works of <hi>Creation</hi> we may say, <hi>The Finger of God is here!</hi> And we may make the Positions of the <hi>Pauline</hi> Philosophy, in Acts 17. 24, 28. <hi>God made the World, and all Things therein; In Him we Live and Move and have our Being.</hi> Upon all the Works of <hi>Providence,</hi> we may say, <hi>This comes from that God, whose Kingdome Ruleth over all.</hi> And we may make the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions once taught by our Lord, no doubt alluding to the <hi>Two Birds,</hi> whereof one was to be <hi>killed,</hi> the other to be <hi>Let Loose into the Open Field,</hi> at the cleansing of the <hi>Leper,</hi> in Mat. 10. 29. <hi>Two Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, one of them shall not fall on the Ground without our Father.</hi> To be Led unto some Notice of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:185005:9"/> GOD continually, This, O This, it is <hi>Angelical.</hi> 'Tis <hi>Godliness.</hi> What is <hi>Holiness,</hi> but <hi>Godliness?</hi> This were a little of the <hi>Angelical Holiness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Our continual <hi>Apprehension</hi> of GOD, may bring a continual <hi>Dedication</hi> to GOD, upon all that we <hi>Have,</hi> and all that we <hi>Do.</hi> If we <hi>Glance</hi> at <hi>Inferiour Ends,</hi> yet we may not <hi>Stop</hi> there: All our <hi>Ends</hi> are to be Swallowed up in GOD. We should not, with any patience consent unto it, that any but GOD, should have our <hi>Strength,</hi> our <hi>Time,</hi> our <hi>All.</hi> Whatever <hi>Possessions</hi> are bestow'd upon us, we may put them under that Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>David</hi> had, in Psalâ–ª 30. <hi>Tit. Dedicated Things.</hi> All our <hi>Possessions,</hi> all the Powers of our <hi>Spirits,</hi> all the Members of our <hi>Bodies,</hi> our <hi>Estates,</hi> our <hi>Credit,</hi> our Desireable <hi>Friends;</hi> we may contrive with our selve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>What Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may GOD have out of these Things:</hi> And Improve them no farther, than as <hi>Instruments,</hi> whereby GOD may be <hi>Acknowledged.</hi> Yea, and our daily <hi>Actions;</hi> may we not be driving a <hi>Trade</hi> for GOD in all? As 'tis said, in 1 Cor. 10. 31. <hi>Whatever ye do, do all to the Glory of God:</hi> So, our <hi>Eating,</hi> our <hi>Drinking,</hi> our <hi>Sleeping,</hi> what is it for? We may distinctly say, <hi>I do This, that I may be supported in the Service of God.</hi> Thus, our <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,</hi> our <hi>Travels,</hi> our <hi>Visits,</hi> and our Exercises of <hi>Religion,</hi> we may thus Ennoble them, <hi>I do This, I will do it carefully and cheerfully, because God hath Commanded my doing of it.</hi> A <hi>Dedication</hi> to GOD, is the proper meaning of <hi>Holiness:</hi> And very <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:185005:9"/> would be our <hi>Holiness,</hi> if we could be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and constant in such Acts of <hi>Dedication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly; Our continual <hi>Apprehension</hi> of GOD, may produce our continual <hi>Satisfaction</hi> in GOD, under all His <hi>Dispensations.</hi> Whatever <hi>Enjoyments</hi> are by God conferred upon us, where lies the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> where the <hi>Sweetness</hi> of them? Truly, we may come to Relish our <hi>Enjoyments,</hi> only <hi>so far</hi> as we have something of GOD in them. It was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Psal. 37 4. <hi>Delight thy self in the Lord.</hi> Yea, And what if we should have no <hi>Delight,</hi> but the <hi>Lord?</hi> Let us ponder with our selves, over our <hi>Enjoyments; In these Enjoyments I See God, and by these Enjoyments I Serve God!</hi> And now, Let all our <hi>Delight</hi> in, and all our Value and Fondness, for our <hi>Enjoyments,</hi> be <hi>Only,</hi> or <hi>Mainly,</hi> upon such a <hi>Divine Score</hi> as <hi>This.</hi> As far as any of our <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments</hi> Lead us unto GOD, so far let us Relish it, Affect it, Embrace it, and Rejoyce in it; <hi>O Tast, and Feed upon God in all;</hi> and Ask for Nothing, no, not for <hi>Life</hi> it self, any further than as it may help us, in our <hi>Seeing,</hi> and our <hi>Serving,</hi> of our GOD. And then, whatever <hi>Afflictions,</hi> do lay Fetters upon us, Let us not only Remember, that we are concerned with GOD therein, but let our concernment with GOD procure a very profound <hi>Submission</hi> in our Souls. Be able to say, with him, in Psal. 39. 9. <hi>I opened not my mouth, because Thou didst it.</hi> In all our <hi>Afflictions,</hi> Let us Remark the <hi>Justice</hi> of that GOD, before whom, <hi>Why should a Living man Complain for the Punishment of his Sin?</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:185005:10"/> the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of that GOD, <hi>whose Judgments are Right;</hi> the <hi>Goodness</hi> of that GOD, who <hi>Punishes us less than our Iniquities do deserve.</hi> Let us behave our selves, as having to Do with none but GOD, in our <hi>Afflictions:</hi> And let our <hi>Afflictions</hi> make us more conformable unto GOD; which Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty being Effected, Let us then say, <hi>'Tis Good for me that I have been Afflicted.</hi> Sirs, what were this, but a pitch of <hi>Holiness,</hi> almost <hi>Angelical!</hi> Oh! Mount up as with the <hi>Wings of Eagles,</hi> of <hi>Angels;</hi> be not a sorry, puiny, Mechanick sort of <hi>Christians</hi> any longer; but <hi>Reach Forth</hi> unto these things, that are thus before you!</p>
            <p>But, in fine, 'Tis our Lord JESUS CHRIST, who is, <hi>The Face of God. That</hi> is His <hi>Name,</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in the Old Testament; and in this <hi>Hint,</hi> I have given you a <hi>Golden Key</hi> to come at the sense of many passages in the Sacred Pages, about, <hi>The Face of God,</hi> and, <hi>The Light of that Face:</hi> 'Twas the <hi>Messiah.</hi> Tis then our Lord JESUS CHRIST, who is to be the more <hi>Immediate Object</hi> of our <hi>Apprehensions,</hi> when we would become <hi>Angolical;</hi> 'Tis God in our Lord JESUS CHRIST: When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we entertain any Thing of GOD in our minds, it should be with a CHRIST, and thro' a CHRIST. Those who do all they can, to Forge a CHRISTIANITY, without a CHRIST, are so far from Like <hi>Angels</hi> of the Lord, that they are <hi>Traitors</hi> to the King of Heaven!</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> We may render our selves <hi>Angelical,</hi> by our Endeavours of a <hi>present,</hi> and <hi>a pleasant</hi> and an
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:185005:10"/>
               <hi>Universal Obedience,</hi> unto the Lord JESUS CHRIST, the <hi>Lord of Angels.</hi> Who's are the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> but the <hi>Angels of the Lord?</hi> And, [as in 1 Kin. 18. 12. and Act. 8. 39.] <hi>The Spirits of the Lord.</hi> Our Lord JESUS CHRIST is the <hi>Lord General</hi> of all the <hi>Angels;</hi> He is the <hi>Lord of Hosts;</hi> and all those <hi>Hosts</hi> of Heaven are under His Command; We read in Psal. 103. 20, 21. <hi>They do His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, Hearkening unto the Voice of His Word: They are His Ministers which do His Pleasure.</hi> The very Highest <hi>Angel</hi> in Heaven desires and studies to be a <hi>Servant</hi> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST: The Great God, would soon strike him down from Heaven, with Hot Thunder-bolts, if he did not so. Even <hi>Michael,</hi> the <hi>Archangel,</hi> ha's Receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Charge from God, concerning our Lord-Redeemer, <hi>Do thou Worship Him! Gabriel</hi> himself, must give this Account of himself, <hi>I stand in the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ;</hi> namely, As a <hi>Servant</hi> standing in the <hi>Presence</hi> of his Master.</p>
            <p>Come then; Let every one of us, become the <hi>Servants</hi> of our Lord JESUS CHRIST. By con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to the Methods of <hi>Grace</hi> in the <hi>New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> Let us yield our selves unto our Lord JESUS CHRIST, as unto our LORD; and say, with him in Psal. 119. 38. <hi>Lord, I am thy Servant, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted unto thy Fear.</hi> Let us Reckon it the Highest <hi>Pleasure</hi> unto our selves, to be alwayes <hi>Pleasing</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ: Let us Esteem it the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>Honour</hi> unto our selves, to be alwayes <hi>Honouring</hi> of Him. To be, <hi>A Man of God,</hi> is to be like an
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:185005:11"/>
               <hi>Angel,</hi> An <hi>Angel</hi> was called, in Judg. 13. 8. <hi>The Man of God.</hi> We are <hi>Men of God,</hi> when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the <hi>Devoted Servants</hi> of our Lord JESUS CHRIST. Sirs, The Bright <hi>Angels</hi> of Heaven, Invite us, to become their <hi>Fellow Servants,</hi> by giving our selves up unto the work of <hi>Witnessing</hi> to the <hi>Truths</hi> and <hi>Wayes,</hi> of their Heavenly Lord. When we have Solemnly Consecrated our selves unto this Work, Then, whatever <hi>Commands</hi> our Lord JESUS CHRIST layes upon us, Let us Readily, Joyfully, Universally yield <hi>Obedience</hi> thereunto. Be upon the <hi>Wing,</hi> as the <hi>Angels</hi> are, to do every thing, that our Lord Jesus Christ would have to be done.

The <hi>Angels</hi> are alwayes Employ'd in some Service, for our Lord Jesus Christ, and for those that belong unto Him. 'Tis said, in Heb. 1. 14. <hi>Are they not all Ministring Spirits?</hi> Oh! Let it, in like sort, be our Ambition, to <hi>Minister</hi> some way or other, for the <hi>Good</hi> of them, that are to be the <hi>Heirs of Salvation;</hi> and let us be much and oft, in studying with our selves, <hi>What Good may I do, with those Talents, where with my Lord Jesus Christ ha's betrusted me?</hi> How many <hi>Good Offices,</hi> does the <hi>Bible</hi> Report, as done by the <hi>Angels</hi> of God, for the <hi>People</hi> of God?

Great Things did the <hi>Angels</hi> do for <hi>Moses,</hi> Great Things for <hi>Elias,</hi> who often spent <hi>whole Dayes</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone with the Lord; And what said an <hi>Angel</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Daniel,</hi> when he had been spending <hi>whole Days</hi> at such a rate, <hi>Thou art a man of Desires, and an Angel thinks not much to fly down from Heaven unto thy Conversation!</hi> Such <hi>Dayes,</hi> do leave an <hi>Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Savour</hi> upon the <hi>Souls</hi> of men; they Leave our <hi>Souls,</hi> for many Dayes afterward, under such a Gracious, and Generous, and Serious, &amp; Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and Useful <hi>Biass,</hi> as has the <hi>Face</hi> of an <hi>Angel</hi> thereupon. And therefore, the <hi>Lords Dayes;</hi> Let us keep <hi>them</hi> with a peculiar Sollicitude, a singular Elevation, of <hi>Sanctity.</hi> It was the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>John,</hi> in Rev. 1. 10. To be <hi>in the Spirit on the Lords Day.</hi> Syrs, If we are so, we shall be <hi>with the Angels on the Lords Day;</hi> And if <hi>with</hi> them, then <hi>like</hi> them. To be wholly under the <hi>Confinement,</hi> [I mistook the word, I should say, <hi>Liberty!]</hi> of <hi>Religious Applications,</hi> throughout our whole <hi>Christian Sabbath,</hi> Let us not count it, as a Ceremonious person once call'd it, <hi>A being on the Rack a whole Day together. Angels</hi> have strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly visited and comforted some on the <hi>Rack;</hi> but never such as complain'd, that a strict <hi>Lords Day</hi> put 'em on a <hi>Rack.</hi> During the whole Day, Let our <hi>Thoughts</hi> be full of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> During the whole Day, Let our <hi>words</hi> be
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:185005:13"/>
               <hi>Few,</hi> and <hi>Fitt,</hi> and <hi>Savoury,</hi> and such as may <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister Grace unto the Hearers;</hi> During the whole Day, Let our <hi>Earthly Defilements</hi> be Banished from us; Let our Hearts, be every Hour Sallying forth with Numberless <hi>Ejaculations</hi> to the Lord. Such <hi>Lords Dayes,</hi> will <hi>Ripen</hi> men into <hi>Angels</hi> at the Last! But on the <hi>Lords-Day,</hi> there sometimes does Recur, a most special and signal opportunity to <hi>Draw near unto God;</hi> namely, <hi>The Lords Supper;</hi> an Ordinance of the <hi>Nearest Fellowship</hi> with Heaven; an Ordinance, wherein a CHRIST Suffering for us, is, by the Symbols of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> so tendred unto the Faithful, that in their Obeving His Appointment thereof, they do with Ineffable Advantage partake of Him. Well then, Let our <hi>Preparations</hi> for this Great Ordinance, be with as much of Solemnity, as if we were to <hi>Dy</hi> our selves, at the Time, when we do <hi>Annun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate</hi> here the <hi>Death of our Lord.</hi> Let us <hi>Examine</hi> our selves, &amp; <hi>Supplicate</hi> our God, before we come to the <hi>Table</hi> of the Lord, as if we were to <hi>Dy</hi> when we come. And at this <hi>Holy Table,</hi> where <hi>Man Eats Angels Food,</hi> Let us <hi>Fix</hi> our <hi>Meditations</hi> on our LORD JESUS CHRIST, with all possible <hi>Attention,</hi> with all suitable <hi>Affection.</hi> Thus, <hi>Behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as in a Glass, the Glory of the Lord, we shall be Changed into the same Image, from Glory to Glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> Now, 'tis that <hi>Glory</hi> that makes an <hi>Angel!</hi>

But it cannot be any other than a Grief unto those <hi>Angels,</hi> to see <hi>Enormities,</hi> in those, for whose welfare they are concerned.
